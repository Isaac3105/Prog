Love is a fire that burns unseen
a wound that aches yet is not felt
an always discontent contentment
a pain that rages without hurting

a longing for nothing but to long
a loneliness in the midst of people
a never feeling pleased when pleased
a passion that gains when lost in thought

It’s being enslaved of your own free will
it’s counting your defeat a victory
it’s staying loyal to your killer

But if it’s so self-contradictory
how can Love, when Love chooses
bring human hearts into sympathy
